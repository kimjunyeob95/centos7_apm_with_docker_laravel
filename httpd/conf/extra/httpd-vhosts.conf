# Virtual Hosts
#
# Required modules: mod_log_config

# If you want to maintain multiple domains/hostnames on your
# machine you can setup VirtualHost containers for them. Most configurations
# use only name-based virtual hosts so the server doesn't need to worry about
# IP addresses. This is indicated by the asterisks in the directives below.
#
# Please see the documentation at 
# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/vhosts/>
# for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.
#
# You may use the command line option '-S' to verify your virtual host
# configuration.

#
# VirtualHost example:
# Almost any Apache directive may go into a VirtualHost container.
# The first VirtualHost section is used for all requests that do not
# match a ServerName or ServerAlias in any <VirtualHost> block.
#


# <VirtualHost *:80>
#     ServerName "boosters-labs.com"
#     Redirect permanent / http://www.boosters-labs.kr/
# </VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:80>
    
    ServerName localhost
    DocumentRoot "/home/centos/dev/stage/web/public"
    Redirect permanent / https://localhost/

    # <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    #     RewriteEngine On
    #     RewriteCond %{HTTP:X-Forwarded-Proto} =http
    #     RewriteRule .* https://%{HTTP:Host}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=permanent]
    # </IfModule>
